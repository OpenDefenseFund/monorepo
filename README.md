### Mission

### Moderation

Currently, only 1 existing member needs to approve of your pull request and you will then be granted full push permission. All work must be open source, built in public. If you are a for-profit or blockchain entity, you are expected to commit funds. No future-facing projections are permitted, as such all teams will be continuously subject to ethics disclosures and members are encouraged to constructively criticize each other, especially across replicable engineering standards. Public podcasts of debates and challenges will be promoted, proofs will be prioritized as pragmatic over philosophies alone.

### Application

 > **Are you seeking funding, grants, a fellowship or job?**

If you align with ODF's mission, [please write a proposal](./how-to-apply-for-funding-or-speak/README.md) and submit it as a pull request, and we will route it to an appropriate person for review. This can be for a conference or an art project, to show off a code demo, or anything relevant. Try to at least showcase any past project(s) you are proud of.

### Donation

**Volunteer**. Individuals are highly encouraged to volunteer time by contributing code towards projects and teams that you align with, directly. There is no need for ODF to be a middleman, but if you have questions we will help you - simply open a pull request. While GitHub is centralized, git is not. Action is better than talk.

**Investment**. Find a member organization that aligns with your values and legally invest in them through accredited means. There is strong disagreement in ODF over the validity of tokens, and is one of the most debated subjects. No financial entity exists for the Open Defense Fund, members hold and deploy the capital. If you still want to contribute to ODF's mission directly, we will treat you as a customer in a co-op union with credits towards conferences and other online or in-person events. You will be given early bulk tickets and advertising space as a corporate sponsor of the conference or event, you are authorized to sell these tickets but we will actively encourage you to donate them for free to your firm's employees or award them to grant applicants. We are here to grow a community, and reduce margins or barriers to entry into a multi-cultural web that is not monopolized by closed-source or closed-door political actors. Such actions by ODF cannot be misconstrued as a devaluing of any purchased credits, they are meant for the growth of pro-human innovation and adoption, not capital gain.
