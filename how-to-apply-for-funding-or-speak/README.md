Interested in getting hired at one of the member organizations?

1. [Click this link to start](https://github.com/OpenDefenseFund/monorepo/edit/main/how-to-apply-for-funding-or-speak/README.md) your own 'fork' of ODF.

2. Important: Then change the file name from `README.md` to your name.

3. Explain your idea, link to what you have done, ask for what you want done.

4. 'Commit' it and a 'Pull Request' button should appear at the top of your page. Click it.Give it a nice summarizing title, optionally explain anything else, then click the 'Create pull request' button.

5. We're all very busy so we may not see it at first. So please, go find all our twitters (or other contact info) and actively tweet the pull request link at us. Plus get anyone else to comment on it as well! Be vocal, represent yourself. Keep trying until you find someone to review it. Your idea is worth that effort, at minimum, yes?

6. Be prepared. We're not your trainer or coach, we're not your mom. We're here to *respectfully* wrestle with your proposal. We will look for the good in it, but we also have an engineering obligation to remove any weaknesses in it.

7. Once someone is assigned to review it, they'll likely come back with questions and challenges for you to revise in your proposal. Next up, **if the proposal is interesting** to them, they'll probably challenge you to a public podcast to debate it. Correct, if we like an idea, we'll promote an interview asking you hard questions. It does not mean we agree with you. But what we think doesn't matter. What matters is the opportunity to prove yourself for anyone in the world, then they can come to you directly. That's what legends are made of.

8. Your Pull Request will then either be merged or reset back to (5). The world is changed by outsiders, so don't let anyone become an authority to you. Keep trying until you have repeated this process [7,932,487,716 times](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).

Nothing stops you from forking the fund, renaming it, and then starting your own community.

# FAQ

### Why was I not invited to apply?

I don't know. Ask? Maybe someone was jealous of your success and tried to exclude you. That sucks, let's change it. The only way to find out how or why is to apply.

### I need to chat with you privately before applying.

That's not a question. You're free to do whatever you want, try messaging people. Likewise, you're not entitled to their time - they're dealing with their own traumas. Some have bills to pay, a grandparent who died. So be careful, trying helping them first, but even then, expect nothing.

In all cases, the answer is no. If you need to talk to someone in private, try calling your mom (hopefully she's still alive... and nice, if so, she says she misses you!). If you're not brave enough to be transparent about your idea in public, you're success is likely to be 0% or you do not truly believe in Open Source.
